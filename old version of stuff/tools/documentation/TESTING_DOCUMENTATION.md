## 2. Temporal Integrity Tests (Critical for Data Leakage Prevention)

### Purpose
**This is the most critical test suite** - it ensures the forecasting system never uses future information to make predictions, which would invalidate all scientific results and render the system useless for real-world forecasting.

### Test Components

#### 2.1 Lag Feature Temporal Cutoff Test
- **Purpose**: Ensures lag features (da_lag_1, da_lag_2, da_lag_3) never access future data
- **Method**: Creates temporal buffers around prediction dates
- **Validation**: Confirms lag features are NaN when they would contain future information

#### 2.2 Temporal Split Ordering Test
- **Purpose**: Validates strict chronological separation between training and test data
- **Method**: Checks that max(training_dates) < min(test_dates)
- **Critical**: Prevents temporal contamination

#### 2.3 DA Category Independence Test
- **Purpose**: Ensures target categories are created independently per forecast
- **Method**: Verifies categories use only training data statistics
- **Prevents**: Information leakage through global statistics

#### 2.4 Preprocessing Fit-Only-On-Training Test
- **Purpose**: Ensures scalers, imputers, and transformers are fit only on training data
- **Method**: Validates that preprocessing statistics come from training data only
- **Critical**: Prevents subtle but serious forms of data leakage

#### 2.5 Temporal Integrity Validation Function Test
- **Purpose**: Tests the built-in temporal validation system
- **Method**: Verifies the system can detect temporal violations
- **Ensures**: Continuous monitoring of data integrity

#### 2.6 Forecast Engine Initialization Test
- **Purpose**: Validates core forecasting components initialize without errors
- **Method**: Tests ForecastEngine class instantiation and basic functionality

#### 2.7 Minimum Training Samples Test
- **Purpose**: Ensures forecasts require sufficient historical data
- **Method**: Validates minimum sample size requirements

### Success Criteria
**ALL 7/7 tests must pass** - This is non-negotiable for scientific validity.

### What Success Means
✅ **Scientific Validity**: Results are scientifically sound and publishable
✅ **No Data Leakage**: Zero future information contamination
✅ **Peer Review Ready**: Meets scientific community standards
✅ **Real-World Applicable**: Forecasts use only available information
✅ **Reproducible Research**: Results can be independently verified

**Critical Note**: Failure of any temporal integrity test would invalidate the entire forecasting system's scientific credibility.
