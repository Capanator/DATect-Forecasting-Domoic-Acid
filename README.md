XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=8,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8
)

```

## 🔒 Temporal Safeguards (Zero Data Leakage)

The system implements comprehensive temporal safeguards to ensure scientific validity:

### Core Safeguards
1. **Temporal Data Splitting**: Data split by date BEFORE feature engineering
2. **Minimum Temporal Buffers**: 7-day separation between training and test data
3. **Forward-Only Interpolation**: Missing values filled using only historical data
4. **Lag Feature Protection**: Temporal cutoffs prevent future information leakage
5. **Per-Forecast Processing**: DA categories created independently for each forecast
6. **Preprocessing Isolation**: Statistics computed only from training data

### Configuration Parameters
```python
TEMPORAL_BUFFER_DAYS = 1      # Minimum days between training and prediction
SATELLITE_BUFFER_DAYS = 7     # Satellite data temporal cutoff
CLIMATE_BUFFER_MONTHS = 2     # Climate index reporting delays
```

## 📈 Model Performance

### Regression Performance (μg/g DA prediction)
- **XGBoost R²**: 0.736 (7.4% better than Random Forest baseline)
- **Average MAE**: 4.18 μg/g
- **Cross-site Performance**: Excellent (Coos Bay R² = 0.96) to Challenging (Newport R² = 0.09)

### Classification Performance (Risk categories)
- **Categories**: Low (0-5), Moderate (5-20), High (20-40), Extreme (>40 μg/g)
- **XGBoost Accuracy**: Superior performance across all risk levels
- **Early Warning**: Model predictions often lead actual measurements

| **🏆 Mid Frequency** | 4-26 weeks | **0.761** | **Optimal for bloom cycles** |
| **High Frequency** | <4 weeks | 0.601 | Captures short-term variations |

#### 📊 **Key Spectral Findings**

##### **1. Optimal Frequency Response**
- **Best performance at 4-26 week periods**: Matches natural HAB bloom cycles
- **76.1% coherence** in mid-frequency band indicates strong signal capture
- **Monthly to seasonal patterns**: XGBoost excels at biologically relevant timescales

##### **2. Temporal Pattern Recognition**
```
Dominant Periods in Actual DA:
• 25.0 weeks (0.48 years) - Semi-annual cycle
• 12.5 weeks (0.24 years) - Quarterly variations  
• 8.3 weeks (0.16 years) - Monthly-bimonthly patterns
```

##### **3. Predictive Behavior**
- **Phase Analysis**: XGBoost predictions often **lead** actual measurements by 3-24°
