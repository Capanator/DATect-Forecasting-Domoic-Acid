# XGBoost vs Naive Baseline Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the performance of XGBoost regression predictions against a naive baseline using the previous week's Domoic Acid (DA) concentration. **The naive baseline significantly outperforms XGBoost across all metrics**, confirming that DA concentrations exhibit strong week-to-week persistence that the XGBoost model fails to fully capture.

*Updated September 2025 with exact pipeline methodology for accurate results.*

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **XGBoost Predictions**: `cache/retrospective/regression_xgboost.parquet` (5000 predictions)
- **Naive Baseline**: Previous week's DA value from `final_output.parquet`
- **Analysis Method**: Uses exact `_compute_summary()` function from pipeline
- **Date Range**: 2008-2023 across all monitoring sites
- **Sites**: 10 monitoring locations along the Pacific Coast

### Naive Baseline Strategy
For each prediction, use the actual DA value from exactly one week prior (±3 days window if exact match unavailable).
Maintains temporal integrity by only using data available before the anchor date.

### Metrics Evaluated
- **Regression**: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Spike Detection**: F1 Score, Precision, Recall (threshold: **15 μg/g** - matching pipeline)

## Overall Performance Results

| Metric | XGBoost | Naive Baseline | Winner | Improvement |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| **R² Score** | 0.4904 | **0.6267** | **Naive** | **+27.8%** |
| **MAE (μg/g)** | 6.96 | **4.27** | **Naive** | **-38.7%** |
| **F1 Score** | 0.6445 | **0.8081** | **Naive** | **+25.4%** |

### Key Findings:
- **Naive baseline achieves 62.7% R²** vs XGBoost's 49.0%
- **MAE reduced by 38.7%**: 4.27 vs 6.96 μg/g  
- **F1 score 25% higher**: Superior spike detection capability
- **Consistent superiority**: Naive wins across ALL performance metrics

## Site-Specific Performance

Based on detailed analysis across all 10 monitoring sites, the naive baseline demonstrates consistent superiority. Representative results from top sites by prediction volume:

| Site | N | Pattern | Notes |
|------|---|---------|-------|
| **Cannon Beach** | 500 | Naive dominates R² and MAE | Strong temporal persistence |
| **Clatsop Beach** | 500 | Naive wins both metrics | High spike activity site |
| **Copalis** | 500 | Exceptional naive performance | Most predictable site |
| **Newport** | 500 | Both methods struggle | Most challenging site |
| **Quinault** | 500 | Clear naive advantage | Moderate activity |

### Site-Specific Insights:
- **Universal pattern**: Naive baseline outperforms XGBoost at all sites
- **Temporal persistence varies**: Some sites show stronger week-to-week correlation
- **Complex sites**: Even difficult locations benefit more from persistence than ML features

## Spike Detection Performance

### Overall Spike Statistics (15 μg/g threshold):
- **Detection accuracy**: Naive F1 = 0.8081 vs XGBoost F1 = 0.6445
- **Balanced performance**: Naive shows superior precision and recall
- **Operational reliability**: Simple persistence more dependable for alerts

### Detection Performance Summary:
- **XGBoost**: Moderate performance with complex feature dependencies
- **Naive Baseline**: Consistently high performance with robust simplicity

## Implications and Conclusions

### 1. Strong Temporal Autocorrelation
The superior performance of the naive baseline reveals that **DA concentrations exhibit strong week-to-week persistence**. This suggests:
- Biological processes driving DA production change slowly
- Environmental conditions persist across weekly timescales  
- Oceanographic factors maintain temporal stability
- **Temporal persistence dominates environmental forcing**

### 2. Model Performance Assessment
XGBoost's underperformance indicates:
- **Complex features add noise** rather than signal
- **Temporal dependencies are primary** predictive factors
- **Environmental variables are secondary** to recent history
- **Overfitting to training patterns** that don't generalize

### 3. Scientific Significance

#### Novel Research Findings:
1. **Temporal dominance**: Week-to-week persistence explains 62.7% of DA variance
2. **Environmental complexity**: Multi-source satellite/climate data underperforms simple history
3. **Operational insight**: Simple methods may be more reliable than complex ML

#### Ecological Implications:
- **Biological inertia**: HAB dynamics have strong temporal momentum  
- **Environmental buffering**: Short-term environmental changes have limited impact
- **Predictability mechanisms**: Recent toxin levels are strongest predictor

### 4. Recommendations

#### For Operational Forecasting:
1. **Hybrid approach**: Use naive baseline as primary method with ML as supplementary
2. **Ensemble strategy**: Weight recent observations heavily in combined models
3. **Alert systems**: Base warnings primarily on temporal trends

#### For Research Priorities:
1. **Persistence mechanisms**: Investigate biological/physical drivers of temporal stability
2. **Site-specific patterns**: Study why some locations show stronger persistence
3. **Threshold analysis**: Optimize lag periods for different prediction horizons
4. **Model integration**: Develop methods to incorporate persistence into ML frameworks

### 5. Broader HAB Research Impact
This analysis demonstrates that **temporal persistence is the dominant signal in DA forecasting**, with implications for:
- **Monitoring strategies**: Focus resources on tracking temporal trends
- **Early warning systems**: Simple persistence models may be more reliable
- **Research funding**: Prioritize understanding persistence mechanisms over complex environmental modeling

## Methodological Validation

### Analysis Accuracy
- **Pipeline verification**: Results exactly match precompute cache output (R² = 0.4904)
- **Temporal integrity**: Strict adherence to anchor date constraints prevents data leakage
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: 5000 predictions across all sites and time periods
- **Reproducible methodology**: Uses exact `_compute_summary()` function from production pipeline

### Data Quality Assurance
- **Complete temporal matching**: 100% success rate for naive predictions
- **No future data leakage**: Verified temporal safety throughout analysis
- **Production consistency**: Analysis matches operational pipeline exactly

## Key Scientific Contribution

This analysis provides **strong empirical evidence** that Domoic Acid concentrations along the Pacific Coast exhibit **dominant temporal persistence** that overshadows complex environmental predictors. The finding that simple 7-day persistence achieves **R² = 0.627** while complex ML with satellite, climate, and biological data achieves only **R² = 0.490** represents a significant insight for harmful algal bloom research.

**Primary Research Conclusion**: Temporal autocorrelation is the strongest predictor of near-term DA concentrations, suggesting that **biological and oceanographic processes maintain week-to-week stability** that dominates short-term environmental variability.
