# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```
**What you get:**
- Beautiful web interface for predictions
- Model selection (2 models available: Ridge Regression, Logistic Classification)
- Input forms for oceanographic data
- Real-time predictions
- System statistics

### 🔬 Scientific Validation (WORKING ✅)
```bash
python3 run_scientific_validation.py
# Results saved to: ./validation_output/
```
**What you get:**
- 4 validation tests (all passing ✅)
- Temporal integrity validation
- Performance metrics
- Statistical analysis
- Research-grade reports

### 📊 Data Processing (WORKING ✅)
```bash
python3 dataset-creation.py
# Updates data from satellite sources (10-60 minutes)
```
**What you get:**
- Latest satellite oceanographic data
- Climate indices and streamflow data
- Processed dataset (10,950+ samples ready)

## 🎯 Recommended Usage

### For Quick Predictions:
1. `python3 run_api_service.py`
2. Open http://localhost:8000
3. Select a model and enter data
4. Get instant predictions!

### For Research/Scientific Work:
1. `python3 run_scientific_validation.py --verbose`
2. Review results in `./validation_output/`
3. All tests should pass ✅

### For Data Updates:
1. `python3 dataset-creation.py` (when you need latest data)

## 🔧 Current System Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Web Interface** | ✅ Working | Beautiful UI, model selection |
| **API Endpoints** | ✅ Mostly Working | /models ✅, /stats ✅, /health ⚠️ |
| **Scientific Validation** | ✅ Working | 4/4 tests passing |
| **Model System** | ✅ Working | 2 models trained and available |
| **Data Pipeline** | ✅ Working | 10,950+ samples ready |

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Unable to load health status"
**Status:** Minor UI issue, doesn't affect predictions
**Solution:** The stats and models endpoints work fine, predictions still function

### Issue: "No models available" 
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - 2 models now available
**Solution:** Models created automatically (Ridge Regression + Logistic Classification)

### Issue: JavaScript errors in browser console
**Status:** Minor, doesn't prevent usage  
**Solution:** Refresh page, predictions still work

## 🎉 You're Ready!

**The system is working!** You can:
- ✅ Make predictions through the web interface
- ✅ Run scientific validation tests  
- ✅ Process and update data
- ✅ Deploy with Docker

**Start here:** `python3 run_api_service.py` → http://localhost:8000
