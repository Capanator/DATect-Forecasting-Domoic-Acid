## Data Integration and Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Multi-Source Environmental Data Acquisition

The system integrates heterogeneous environmental datasets at multiple temporal and spatial scales:

#### Satellite-Derived Ocean State Variables (MODIS-Aqua)
The system processes 8-day composite products from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer:

- **Chlorophyll-a concentration**: Primary productivity proxy and phytoplankton biomass indicator
- **Sea surface temperature**: Thermal regime affecting metabolic rates and species composition
- **Photosynthetically available radiation**: Light field characteristics influencing primary production
- **Fluorescence line height**: Physiological stress indicator for phytoplankton communities
- **Diffuse attenuation coefficient (K490)**: Water column optical properties and turbidity

**Temporal Processing Constraints**: Satellite composites require atmospheric correction and cloud-masking procedures that introduce a 7-day operational delay. The system enforces this realistic constraint to prevent temporal leakage in retrospective validation studies.

#### Large-Scale Climate and Anomaly Indices
Monthly-aggregated indices capture basin-scale oceanographic variability:

- **Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)**: Decadal-scale sea surface temperature patterns affecting North Pacific ecosystem dynamics
- **Oceanic Niño Index (ONI)**: El Niño Southern Oscillation state influencing regional upwelling and temperature regimes
- **Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index (BEUTI)**: Coastal upwelling intensity driving nutrient flux to euphotic zone
- **Chlorophyll-a anomalies**: Deviation from climatological productivity patterns indicating ecosystem state changes
- **Sea surface temperature anomalies**: Thermal anomalies relative to long-term means affecting species distributions

**Data Availability Constraints**: Climate indices require end-of-month data compilation and quality control procedures, resulting in a 2-month reporting delay. The system incorporates this operational constraint to maintain forecast realism.

#### Terrestrial Freshwater Inputs
Columbia River discharge measurements (USGS gauge 14246900) provide:
- **Nutrient loading**: Terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to coastal waters
- **Stratification effects**: Freshwater lens formation affecting vertical mixing dynamics
- **Coastal circulation modification**: Buoyancy-driven flow alterations near river plumes

#### Biological Response Variables
Two decades of monitoring data from state public health and marine resource agencies:
- **Domoic acid concentrations**: Target variable representing neurotoxin levels in shellfish tissue
- **Pseudo-nitzschia cell abundance**: Phytoplankton biomass of toxin-producing diatom species
- **Quality assurance**: Laboratory intercalibration and standardized analytical protocols ensure data consistency

### Stage 2: Data Integration and Feature Engineering

#### Temporal Alignment and Quality Control
Heterogeneous data streams are aligned to a consistent weekly temporal grid while preserving data provenance and uncertainty estimates:
- **Spatial aggregation**: Satellite pixel values are averaged within 4km radius of monitoring sites
- **Temporal interpolation**: Conservative gap-filling using nearest-neighbor approaches for short data gaps
- **Missing data protocols**: Systematic handling of data gaps without forward-looking information

#### Temporal Feature Construction
The system constructs lagged and aggregated features based on established ecological time scales:
- **Temporal lags**: 1-week and 3-week antecedent conditions reflecting phytoplankton growth and toxin production time scales
- **Moving averages**: 2-week and 4-week running means capturing environmental trend information
- **Seasonal anomalies**: Deviation from climatological conditions accounting for natural seasonal cycles

**Temporal Causality**: All derived features maintain strict temporal precedence - only antecedent environmental conditions are used to predict subsequent biological responses, consistent with ecological cause-effect relationships.

### Stage 3: Scientific Validation and Quality Assurance

#### Data Quality Assessment
Comprehensive validation protocols ensure data integrity and biological realism:
- **Range validation**: Measurements constrained to oceanographically realistic bounds
- **Temporal consistency**: Detection of anomalous fluctuations exceeding natural variability
- **Spatial coherence**: Cross-site validation of regional patterns
- **Sample size adequacy**: Minimum data requirements for statistical reliability

#### Temporal Integrity Framework
The system implements seven critical validation tests to prevent temporal data leakage:

1. **Chronological precedence**: Training data strictly precedes prediction target dates
2. **Temporal buffer enforcement**: Minimum separation intervals between training and test periods
3. **Feature boundary validation**: Derived features contain no post-prediction information
4. **Independent forecasting**: Each prediction uses only contemporaneously available data
5. **Operational satellite delays**: 7-day processing buffer matching NASA operational schedules
6. **Climate index delays**: 2-month reporting delays matching NOAA publication schedules  
7. **Cross-site consistency**: Uniform temporal constraints across all monitoring locations

These safeguards ensure that retrospective validation accurately reflects prospective forecasting performance.

### Step 4: Pattern Recognition and Statistical Modeling

The system employs ensemble-based statistical methods to identify complex environmental-biological relationships across multiple temporal and spatial scales.

#### Historical Pattern Analysis
The statistical framework analyzes 21 years of integrated environmental data to identify:
- **Temporal dependencies**: Lagged correlations between environmental drivers and toxin production, particularly at 1-week and 3-week intervals corresponding to phytoplankton generation times
- **Regional heterogeneity**: Site-specific response patterns reflecting local oceanographic conditions and ecosystem dynamics
- **Multi-factor interactions**: Non-linear relationships between co-occurring environmental stressors (e.g., temperature-nutrient interactions during upwelling events)
- **Regime-dependent responses**: Differential ecosystem behavior under varying climate states (PDO phases, ENSO conditions)

#### Ensemble Statistical Framework (XGBoost)
The primary analytical approach utilizes gradient-boosted decision trees that:
- **Capture non-linear relationships**: Identifies threshold effects and interaction terms without pre-specification
- **Quantify variable importance**: Provides interpretable metrics of environmental driver contributions
- **Account for site-specific heterogeneity**: Learns location-dependent response patterns
- **Generate probabilistic predictions**: Produces uncertainty bounds reflecting model confidence and data limitations

**Alternative Statistical Approaches**:
- **Linear regression models**: Provides interpretable coefficients for hypothesis testing
- **Logistic regression**: Generates categorical risk assessments with associated probabilities
- **Both alternatives offer transparent variable relationships suitable for mechanistic interpretation**

### Step 5: Forecast Generation

3. **Model application**: Implementation of trained statistical relationships to current environmental state
4. **Concentration estimation**: Generation of predicted domoic acid levels with associated uncertainty
5. **Uncertainty quantification**: Calculation of prediction intervals based on model variance and data quality
6. **Risk categorization**: Translation to public health categories using established regulatory thresholds

#### Prediction Modalities
- **Continuous predictions (Regression)**: Point estimates of domoic acid concentration with confidence intervals (e.g., 15.2 ± 3.1 μg/g)
- **Categorical predictions (Classification)**: Probabilistic assignment to risk categories (Low/Moderate/High/Extreme) based on regulatory thresholds

### Step 6: Results Interpretation and Validation
