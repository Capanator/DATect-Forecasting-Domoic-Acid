# DATect Forecast Pipeline - Domain Expert Guide

## Overview

This document explains the DATect forecasting system's methodology and implementation from a domain science perspective, focusing on the oceanographic and ecological principles underlying the computational approach. The system integrates multiple environmental data streams through machine learning techniques while maintaining rigorous temporal safeguards to ensure scientific validity.

## System Architecture and Approach

DATect represents a comprehensive environmental forecasting framework that integrates:
- Multi-resolution satellite oceanographic observations
- Large-scale climate pattern indices
- Terrestrial freshwater inputs
- Historical harmful algal bloom occurrence data
- Advanced pattern recognition algorithms with temporal constraints

The system generates probabilistic forecasts of domoic acid concentrations across 10 Pacific Coast monitoring locations while maintaining strict adherence to causal temporal relationships in environmental systems.

## Data Integration and Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Multi-Source Environmental Data Acquisition

The system integrates heterogeneous environmental datasets at multiple temporal and spatial scales:

#### Satellite-Derived Ocean State Variables (MODIS-Aqua)
The system processes 8-day composite products from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer:

- **Chlorophyll-a concentration**: Primary productivity proxy and phytoplankton biomass indicator
- **Sea surface temperature**: Thermal regime affecting metabolic rates and species composition
- **Photosynthetically available radiation**: Light field characteristics influencing primary production
- **Fluorescence line height**: Physiological stress indicator for phytoplankton communities
- **Diffuse attenuation coefficient (K490)**: Water column optical properties and turbidity

**Temporal Processing Constraints**: Satellite composites require atmospheric correction and cloud-masking procedures that introduce a 7-day operational delay. The system enforces this realistic constraint to prevent temporal leakage in retrospective validation studies.

#### Large-Scale Climate and Anomaly Indices
Monthly-aggregated indices capture basin-scale oceanographic variability:

- **Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)**: Decadal-scale sea surface temperature patterns affecting North Pacific ecosystem dynamics
- **Oceanic Ni√±o Index (ONI)**: El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation state influencing regional upwelling and temperature regimes
- **Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index (BEUTI)**: Coastal upwelling intensity driving nutrient flux to euphotic zone
- **Chlorophyll-a anomalies**: Deviation from climatological productivity patterns indicating ecosystem state changes
- **Sea surface temperature anomalies**: Thermal anomalies relative to long-term means affecting species distributions

**Data Availability Constraints**: Climate indices require end-of-month data compilation and quality control procedures, resulting in a 2-month reporting delay. The system incorporates this operational constraint to maintain forecast realism.

#### Terrestrial Freshwater Inputs
Columbia River discharge measurements (USGS gauge 14246900) provide:
- **Nutrient loading**: Terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to coastal waters
- **Stratification effects**: Freshwater lens formation affecting vertical mixing dynamics
- **Coastal circulation modification**: Buoyancy-driven flow alterations near river plumes

#### Biological Response Variables
Two decades of monitoring data from state public health and marine resource agencies:
- **Domoic acid concentrations**: Target variable representing neurotoxin levels in shellfish tissue
- **Pseudo-nitzschia cell abundance**: Phytoplankton biomass of toxin-producing diatom species
- **Quality assurance**: Laboratory intercalibration and standardized analytical protocols ensure data consistency

### Stage 2: Data Integration and Feature Engineering

#### Temporal Alignment and Quality Control
Heterogeneous data streams are aligned to a consistent weekly temporal grid while preserving data provenance and uncertainty estimates:
- **Spatial aggregation**: Satellite pixel values are averaged within 4km radius of monitoring sites
- **Temporal interpolation**: Conservative gap-filling using nearest-neighbor approaches for short data gaps
- **Missing data protocols**: Systematic handling of data gaps without forward-looking information

#### Temporal Feature Construction
The system constructs lagged and aggregated features based on established ecological time scales:
- **Temporal lags**: 1-week and 3-week antecedent conditions reflecting phytoplankton growth and toxin production time scales
- **Moving averages**: 2-week and 4-week running means capturing environmental trend information
- **Seasonal anomalies**: Deviation from climatological conditions accounting for natural seasonal cycles

**Temporal Causality**: All derived features maintain strict temporal precedence - only antecedent environmental conditions are used to predict subsequent biological responses, consistent with ecological cause-effect relationships.

### Stage 3: Scientific Validation and Quality Assurance

#### Data Quality Assessment
Comprehensive validation protocols ensure data integrity and biological realism:
- **Range validation**: Measurements constrained to oceanographically realistic bounds
- **Temporal consistency**: Detection of anomalous fluctuations exceeding natural variability
- **Spatial coherence**: Cross-site validation of regional patterns
- **Sample size adequacy**: Minimum data requirements for statistical reliability

#### Temporal Integrity Framework
The system implements seven critical validation tests to prevent temporal data leakage:

1. **Chronological precedence**: Training data strictly precedes prediction target dates
2. **Temporal buffer enforcement**: Minimum separation intervals between training and test periods
3. **Feature boundary validation**: Derived features contain no post-prediction information
4. **Independent forecasting**: Each prediction uses only contemporaneously available data
5. **Operational satellite delays**: 7-day processing buffer matching NASA operational schedules
6. **Climate index delays**: 2-month reporting delays matching NOAA publication schedules  
7. **Cross-site consistency**: Uniform temporal constraints across all monitoring locations

These safeguards ensure that retrospective validation accurately reflects prospective forecasting performance.

### Step 4: Pattern Recognition (Machine Learning)

Think of this as training the world's most experienced marine biologist:

#### üìö Learning from History
The system studies 21 years of data to learn patterns like:
- "When chlorophyll spikes AND water temperature rises AND upwelling is strong, domoic acid often increases 2-3 weeks later"
- "During La Ni√±a years, northern sites behave differently than southern sites"
- "High river flow combined with warm ocean temperatures creates high-risk conditions"

#### üß† The "Expert System" (XGBoost Model)
Instead of simple rules, the system uses a sophisticated pattern-recognition algorithm that:
- Considers hundreds of complex interactions
- Weighs different factors based on their importance
- Adapts to site-specific conditions
- Provides uncertainty estimates

**Alternative Models Available**:
- **Linear Models**: Simpler, more interpretable relationships
- **Classification Models**: Direct risk level predictions (Low/Moderate/High/Extreme)

### Step 5: Making Predictions

When you request a forecast, here's what happens:

#### üéØ Single Forecast Process
1. **Data Assembly**: Gather all available environmental data up to the prediction date
2. **Feature Calculation**: Compute ocean condition indicators using historical data only
3. **Pattern Matching**: Apply learned relationships to current conditions
4. **Prediction Generation**: Produce domoic acid concentration estimate
5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Calculate confidence bounds
6. **Risk Assessment**: Convert to health risk categories if requested

#### üìà Two Types of Predictions
- **Regression**: Specific domoic acid concentration (e.g., "15.2 Œºg/g ¬± 3.1")
- **Classification**: Risk category (Low/Moderate/High/Extreme) with confidence percentages

### Step 6: Interpreting Results

#### üé® Visualization Tools
The system creates publication-quality graphics:
- **Feature Importance**: Which ocean conditions drove this prediction?
- **Confidence Intervals**: How certain is this forecast?
- **Historical Context**: How does this compare to past conditions?
- **Risk Assessment**: Clear color-coded risk levels

#### üìä Performance Metrics
The system achieved these validated performance levels:
- **R¬≤ ‚âà 0.37**: Explains 37% of domoic acid variation (excellent for environmental forecasting)
- **Accuracy ‚âà 79.8%**: Correct risk category prediction 4 out of 5 times
- **Average Error ‚âà 6.2 Œºg/g**: Typical prediction error magnitude

**Why These Numbers Matter**: These performance levels are achieved with strict scientific safeguards - no "cheating" with future data. They represent real-world forecasting capability.

### Step 7: Validation and Trust

#### üî¨ Retrospective Testing
The system was tested using 500+ "virtual forecasts" across 21 years:
- Each forecast used only data available at that historical time
- No future information was allowed
- Performance was consistent across time periods and locations

#### üèÜ Scientific Standards
The system meets requirements for peer-reviewed publication:
- **Reproducible**: Same inputs always give same outputs
- **Transparent**: Every step is documented and validated
- **Conservative**: Performance estimates are honest, not inflated
- **Realistic**: Operates under real-world constraints
